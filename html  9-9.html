                <p>All-rounder Deepti Sharma on Tuesday was named the ICC Women’s Player of the Month for December 2023 following her batting and bowling brilliance in all three formats securing notable victories for India over England and Australia.

The all-rounder started the month in subdued fashion in the T20I encounters against England, before owning the stage in the first Test against England in Mumbai.

Striking 67 with the bat in the first innings, contributing to a mammoth first innings total, the off-spinner then flourished with the ball, taking five key wickets to skittle the tourists in the first innings and four in the second, to finish with staggering match figures of nine for 39 and claim the Player of the Match award.</p>
